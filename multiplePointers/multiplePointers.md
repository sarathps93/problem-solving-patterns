# Multiple Poiters Pattern
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition

Very efficient for solving problems with minimum space complexity as well.

It works well on sorted arrays.

## Performace
Time complexity - O(n)
Space complexity - O(1)
